<P>Though ClearCase::Argv is itself quite small, it represents the
<EM>``Grand Unification''</EM> of some of my other ClearCase-related modules.
The module itself is fully documented in the standard POD format; this
is an accompanying overview and chronology.</P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_Interoperability%2FPortability">Interoperability/Portability</A></STRONG><BR>

Using <STRONG>ClearCase::Argv</STRONG> can greatly enhance portability of scripts
between UNIX and Windows by providing versions of <EM>system</EM>, <EM>exec</EM>,
and <EM>qx</EM> (aka backquotes) which behave the same on Windows as on UNIX.
Ok, almost the same. This includes automatically quoting arguments to
protect them from the <CODE>cmd.exe</CODE> shell, automatically converting
/-separated pathnames to \, etc. This can keep a lot of hair out
of your script.
<P></P>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_Optional_Co%2DProcess_for_Speed">Optional Co-Process for Speed</A></STRONG><BR>

For any script uses ClearCase::Argv, the 'ipc_cleartool' class method
<PRE>
        ClearCase::Argv-&gt;ipc_cleartool;</PRE>
<P>will start <STRONG>cleartool</STRONG> as an <STRONG>IPC::ClearTool</STRONG> co-process and arrange to
send all subsequent system/exec/qx commands to it instead of forking a
new child process each time. This can speed up scripts by anywhere
between 2 and 10 times.</P>
<P></P>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_Convenience_Features">Convenience Features</A></STRONG><BR>

Many convenience features are provided by the replacement
system/exec/qx functions. These include:
<PRE>
    1. 'autochomp' mode (chomps lines automatically, natch)
    2. 'autofail' mode (exit on child process failure)
    3. 'noexec' mode (print cmds without executing, like make -n)
    4. 'xargs' mode (breaks long cmd lines up to avoid system limits)</PRE>
<P>plus a few more.</P>
<P></P>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_No_Major_Investment">No Major Investment</A></STRONG><BR>

It's easy to convert an existing script to use ClearCase::Argv or
back.  Just change all instances of backquotes to <CODE>qv()</CODE> and remove
any existing Win32-porting hackery. To go back to native style, either
change <CODE>qv()</CODE> to <CODE>qx()</CODE> (<EM>backquotes are generally deprecated in
favor of qx anyway</EM>), or add a line like:
<PRE>
        sub qv { qx(@_) }</PRE>
<P>And remove the 'use ClearCase::Argv' line of course.</P>
<P></P>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_Option_Processing">Option Processing</A></STRONG><BR>

There's a great deal of option-processing power inherited from the
base class, much more in fact than most users will care about.

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="chronology">CHRONOLOGY</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ipc::cleartool">IPC::ClearTool</A></H2>
<P>I wrote <STRONG>IPC::ClearTool</STRONG> to manage <STRONG>cleartool</STRONG> as a co-process for
reasons of speed. I.e. instead of doing a fork/exec for each
<STRONG>cleartool</STRONG> command it forks just one process in the background and
sends all <STRONG>cleartool</STRONG> commands down to it. This is much (generally
between 2 and 10 times) faster.  Unfortunately <STRONG>IPC::ClearTool</STRONG>
suffered from a few paradigmatic flaws:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
It didn't work on Windows, where there's no such thing as a fork or
a true child process.
<P></P>
<LI>
The interface was/is strange and a little clunky. Not too surprising
considering that UNIX requires 3 different API's <CODE>(system, exec, and
backquotes)</CODE> to handle child processes; jamming all that functionality
into one API is awkward.
<P></P>
<LI>
Due to the above, any script written to the <STRONG>IPC::ClearTool</STRONG> API was
non-portable to Windows and hard to convert back to traditional
system/exec/qx. Thus converting an existing tool to it required a
substantial commitment of time, and using it at all meant a substantial
commitment of faith.
<P></P></UL>
<P>The Windows port was accomplished by calling into the ClearCase
Automation Library, a COM interface first available in ClearCase 3.2.1.
But the other issues remained, until ...</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="argv">Argv</A></H2>
<P>I also have a ClearCase/Perl module called <STRONG>ClearCase::Ct</STRONG>.  This
one's a wrapper that runs on top of <STRONG>cleartool</STRONG> to extend its
functionality and/or allow site policies to be established at the
wrapper level. But this one also suffers an ugly programming model (do
we sense a trend here?). In particular it's necessary to do lots of
shifting, grepping, splicing, and quoting of @ARGV leading to extremely
spaghetti-like code in places, especially when you throw in the need
for UNIX/Windows portability and different shell-quoting rules. So
extensions written to the <STRONG>ClearCase::Ct</STRONG> ``API'' tend to be a nest of
ifdefs (wrong language, I know).</P>
<P>So I started out to rewrite <CODE>ClearCase::Ct</CODE>. The first step was to
write a support module (eventually called <STRONG>Argv</STRONG>) to hide all the
@ARGV machinations under an OO interface. It has plenty of its own docs
so I won't go into it here, but suffice it to say it provides a lot of
ways to manipulate an arg vector.  In fact it provides much more
parsing power than almost anyone would ever need, so although this is
its original reason for existence it's the least interesting to most.</P>
<P><STRONG>Argv</STRONG> also has <EM>execution methods</EM>, i.e. you can execute your Argv
object via <CODE>$obj-</CODE>system()&gt; or <CODE>$obj-</CODE>qx()&gt;. Handling platform
differences (quoting, pathname separators, etc.) in <STRONG>Argv</STRONG> seemed like
a natural extension, so I added that. This lead to convenience methods
like <CODE>$obj-</CODE>autochomp&gt; (should be obvious) and <CODE>$obj-</CODE>qxargs&gt;
(implements xargs-like behavior to ensure that system limits aren't
exceeded), etc.</P>
<P>At this point I realized that though the parsing features had a small
constituency, the portability abstraction of the <EM>execution methods</EM>
might be of interest to many more users. So in order to make that more
accessible I added a <STRONG>functional interface</STRONG>, allowing the single line</P>
<PRE>
    use Argv qw(system exec qv);</PRE>
<P>to overrride the Perl builtins with Argv's relatively platform-
independent versions. Note: <EM>qv</EM> is used because Perl doesn't allow
<CODE>qx()</CODE>, which is itself a synonym for backquotes, to be overridden.
Bottom line, adding the above line - plus converting <CODE>`cmd`</CODE> to
<CODE>qv(cmd)</CODE> - buys a lot of UNIX/Win32 portability.</P>
<P>As of this writing I haven't ever gotten around to rewriting
<CODE>ClearCase::Ct</CODE> to use <STRONG>Argv</STRONG>, but I've used <STRONG>Argv</STRONG> to write lots of
other portable Perl code.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="clearcase::argv">ClearCase::Argv</A></H2>
<P>Note that <STRONG>Argv</STRONG> itself has nothing to do with ClearCase. So I made a
tiny subclass of <STRONG>Argv</STRONG> to tune it for use with <STRONG>cleartool</STRONG>, since I
write a lot of Perl/ClearCase code.  Originally, <STRONG>ClearCase::Argv</STRONG>
simply extended <STRONG>Argv</STRONG> to assume a leading word ``cleartool''. Thus,
while</P>
<PRE>
    Argv-&gt;new('ls', -l');</PRE>
<P>represents an <CODE>&quot;ls -l&quot;</CODE> command,</P>
<PRE>
    ClearCase::Argv-&gt;new('ls', -l');</PRE>
<P>would run <CODE>&quot;cleartool ls -l&quot;</CODE>, and it understands that the 'program' part
of the command line is ``cleartool ci'' (or more properly qw(cleartool ci)).</P>
<P>The <EM>functional interface</EM> of <EM>Argv</EM> is exposed through
<STRONG>ClearCase::Argv</STRONG>, and it's also extended to support methods called
<STRONG>ccsystem(), ccexec(), and ccqx()</STRONG> which automatically prepend
'cleartool'. E.g.:</P>
<PRE>
        my @views = ccqx(lsview -s);</PRE>
<P>Attributes can be set through the functional interface like this:</P>
<PRE>
        my @views = ccqx({autochomp=&gt;1}, lsview -s);</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="grand unification">GRAND UNIFICATION</A></H1>
<P>Then one day I got an email question from Mark Scandariato of
Lucent:</P>
<PRE>
    Do you have any plan to use IPC-ClearTool within ClearCase-Ct? (I'd
    hate to duplicate anything already underway.)</PRE>
<P>I replied that I didn't but it got me to thinking about whether
<CODE>ClearCase::Argv</CODE> could be taught to send its commands to a
co-process.  A few days later I got a chance to play with it and it
came together with surprising ease! This is the big connection that
makes it all pretty neat, IMHO, since you get improved speed,
portability, and ease of use in one package. Without having to make a
major commitment of rewriting code.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="release state">RELEASE STATE</A></H1>
<P>ClearCase::Argv is still considered in ``beta'' state, which I consider
to mean that it works pretty well but I reserve the right to make
interface changes.</P>
