Revision history for Perl extension ClearCase::Argv.

0.01  Thu Sep  2 17:38:37 1999
	- A simple subclass of the Argv module for cleartool-
	  specific use.

0.10  Tue Nov 16 18:00:33 EST 1999
	- added integration with Argv->ipc_childsafe (allows
	  IPC::ClearTool to be used for speed).

0.12  Wed Dec  8 22:45:07 EST 1999
	- Added hacks required to get $obj->comment method working.
	  This works around a flaw in cleartool quoting rules such that
	  there's no way to specify a multiline comment on the
	  command line, in interactive mode. The workaround is to
	  now use $obj->comment("my multi-\nline comment here").
	  This hack is only needed in "ipc mode" but is supported
	  in regular mode as well for consistency.

0.13 Wed Dec 22 13:12:37 EST 1999
	- New README.html/pod overview document.

0.14 Tue Jan  4 10:20:15 EST 2000
	- Some syntax mods to track Argv cleanup.

0.15 Mon Jan 10 11:33:07 EST 2000
	- First public release.

0.16 Fri Jan 14 17:45:23 EST 2000
	- Added ccqv() alias to ccqx() for consistency.

0.17 Sun Jan 16 21:19:19 EST 2000
	- Clean up, add comments, more POD sections.
	- Track similar cleanups in Argv 0.46.

0.18 Tue Jan 18 08:28:38 EST 2000
	- Improved behavior in setuid/root case, cleaned up PATH setting

0.19 Tue Feb  1 09:51:54 EST 2000
	INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:
	- Renamed ccsystem() et al to ctsystem() et al.
	  Apologies to anyone inconvenienced but my hope is that
	  the module is still young enough that nobody's depending
	  heavily on it. The new names are more in line with their
	  semantics (they prepend 'cleartool') and this frees up future
	  namespace for possible 'mtsystem()' or whatever.
	- Renamed 'systemxargs' to 'syxargs'.
	- Renamed 'pathnorm' to 'inpathnorm', and added
	  an 'outpathnorm' method as well.
	- Renamed 'cmd' method to 'argv' (to avoid confusion
	  with the $self->ipc_cleartool->cmd() method).
	OTHER CHANGES:
	- Added ->syfail and ->qxfail attributes.
	- Allow hashref attr specifiers to have a leading '-'.
	- Modified the ipc_cleartool method to return the underlying
	  ChildSafe object when called with no args and a non-void context.

0.20 Wed Feb  2 14:53:50 EST 2000
	- Cleaned up ipc_cleartool/Win32 error handling from COM object.

0.21 Thu Feb 10 22:54:32 EST 2000
	- Fixed typo in previous (affected only 'comment' method).
	- Fixed 'comment' method to stop piling up -cq flags.

0.23 Wed May 31 15:43:08 EDT 2000
	- Bugfix: allow single-string commands to manipulate
	  files matching /.*cleartool.*/ without it being mistaken
	  for a command prefix.
	- Fixed spurious warning.

0.24 Fri Aug  4 14:37:07 EDT 2000
	- Changed the test script to abort more gracefully (exit 0)
	  if not run within a VOB.
	- Require Argv 0.53 (no particular reason).

0.25 Sat Dec  9 23:16:25 EST 2000
	- Scripts in ./examples had drifted out of alignment with module,
	  as reported by Martina Riedel.

0.26 Fri Apr  6 11:24:16 EDT 2001
	- Minor improvements to documentation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.00 Sat Aug 25 10:14:16 EDT 2001
	= Test Env: Solaris8/Win2KSP2/Perl5.6/CC4.2
	- Recognizing that the API has reached maturity,
	  I've moved the version to indicate a released state.
	  I'll try hard to stay compatible with 1.00 in
	  subsequent releases.

1.02 Tue Sep 25 11:16:37 EDT 2001
	- Subclass Argv->outpathnorm attribute (to change \ to / after @@).
	- Removed stdopts() backward compatibility alias

1.06 Fri Dec 21 07:50:06 EST 2001
	= Test Env: Solaris8/Win2KSP2/Perl5.6.1/CC5.0
	- Added support for CtCmd.
	- Require use of Argv 1.06 since there are a couple
	  significant bugfixes there.

1.07 Sun Jan 13 22:24:55 EST 2002
	- Work around the spurious "bad free" warning emitted by CtCmd
	  (not clear whether the bug is in Perl, CtCmd, or Solaris
	  but in any case we suppress it here with a scoping hack).
