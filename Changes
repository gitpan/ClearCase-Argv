Revision history for Perl extension ClearCase::Argv.

0.01  Thu Sep  2 17:38:37 1999
	- A simple subclass of the Argv module for cleartool-
	  specific use.

0.10  Tue Nov 16 18:00:33 EST 1999
	- added integration with Argv->ipc_childsafe (allows
	  IPC::ClearTool to be used for speed).

0.12  Wed Dec  8 22:45:07 EST 1999
	- Added hacks required to get $obj->comment method working.
	  This works around a flaw in cleartool quoting rules such that
	  there's no way to specify a multiline comment on the
	  command line, in interactive mode. The workaround is to
	  now use $obj->comment("my multi-\nline comment here").
	  This hack is only needed in "ipc mode" but is supported
	  in regular mode as well for consistency.

0.13 Wed Dec 22 13:12:37 EST 1999
	- New README.html/pod overview document.

0.14 Tue Jan  4 10:20:15 EST 2000
	- Some syntax mods to track Argv cleanup.

0.15 Mon Jan 10 11:33:07 EST 2000
	- First public release.

0.16 Fri Jan 14 17:45:23 EST 2000

0.17 Sun Jan 16 21:19:19 EST 2000

	- Track similar cleanups in Argv 0.46.
